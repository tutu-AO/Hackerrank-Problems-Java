         * Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
         * Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more!
         * Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is
         * printed as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1. If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g.,.1 = 0.1),
         * then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
         *
         * Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange array's elements
         * according to the instructions above.
         * Input Format
         *
         * The first line consists of a single integer,n, denoting the number of integer strings.
         * Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a real number denoting the value of s.*/

         * Given a large integer, n, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine
         * and print whether it's prime or not prime.
         *
         * Input Format:
         * A single line containing an integer,n(the number to be checked).
         *
         * Output Format:
         * If n is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.*/

         * These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.
         * Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.
         *
         * Input Format:
         * There will be two lines containing two numbers, a and b.
         *
         * Output Format:
         * Output two lines. The first line should contain a + b, and the second line should contain a x b.
